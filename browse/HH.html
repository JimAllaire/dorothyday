		An account of the first five years of the Catholic Worker (C.W.).
Describes the C.W. not simply as a newspaper but as a movement.
Explicates its position on labor and unions through Peter Maurin's
ideas on personalism. Much of the book, however, is taken up with
the day to day experiences of the C.W., describing the soup lines,
publication of the paper, picketing, farm communes, and the finances
of the C.W. (DDLW #3)

As a journalist covering the Communist led march on Washington in December 1932, Dorothy yearns and prays to find a way to work for the poor and oppressed.

Includes several of Peter's essays and details about starting the newspaper and their first houses of hospitality. (DDLW #435)
