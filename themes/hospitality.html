	<BLOCKQUOTE>
		An account of the first five years of the Catholic Worker (C.W.).
Describes the C.W. not simply as a newspaper but as a movement.
Explicates its position on labor and unions through Peter Maurin's
ideas on personalism. Much of the book, however, is taken up with
the day to day experiences of the C.W., describing the soup lines,
publication of the paper, picketing, farm communes, and the finances
of the C.W. (DDLW #435)

	<BLOCKQUOTE>
		Meditation on hospitality, that is, seeing Christ in those around us, ministering to others the way Christ ministered and was ministered to; with examples of this from the Scriptures. Encourages all to some form of the "privilege" of hospitality not because people remind us of Christ "but because they are Christ."
