	<BLOCKQUOTE>
		Restates the central vision of the Catholic Worker Movement as working for "a new heaven and a new <I>earth,</I> wherein justice dwelleth." This vision recognizes the "primacy of the spritual" and the doctrine of the Mystical Body of Christ. The Catholic Worker is "a new way of life" involving Houses of Hospitality for the daily practice of the Works of Mercy and Farming Communes where each person can take responsibility of doing their part.

	<BLOCKQUOTE>
		A self-critical appraisal of the Catholic Worker movement's first fifteen years. Readily accepts criticism of their ideals of voluntary poverty and pacifism, failure to implement Peter Maurin's vision, of rigorous and demanding retreats, of internal dissent, and of their approach to helping the poor. Says they have not been good servants nor recognized the failure of the cross and the need to die to self. Says they are in a time of transition with only ten houses remaining.
