**THE WAY OF A PILGRIM (1)**deserves to be set beside **The Imitation of
Christ, The Practice of the Presence of God and The Spiritual
Combat.** And when I read it I thought with joy that here was a teaching
on prayer that could be used by the worker on his way to and from work,
by the busy housewife, by the mother of many children, by the traveller.
This teaching, I thought, had been presented, in a way, by Fr. William
Doyle, S.J. in his constant ejaculatory prayers; by the Protestant Frank
Lauback, in a little pamphlet on his experience in prayer; by Gandhi who
used that simple and primitive prayer of India where in the Name of God
is repeated until the very lips and throat become weary. "I have used
this prayer to banish fear", Ghandi said; by the author of the Cloud of
the Unknowing, who directed us to use some simple word "such a
word is this word **God** or this word **Love**" Fasten this word to
thine heart, with this word thou shalt smite down all manner of
thought under the cloud of forgetting." Then began men to cry aloud
with the Name of Jehovah." Genesis IV.

      From the earliest beginnings of recorded history, men called out
the Name, as a prayer, with a strong cry and tears, directed towards God
in supplications. And in Deuteronomy V, men are told to write down the
commandment of love and bind it on their arms and on their brows, and
wear it on their hearts, and fasten it to their door posts, and gates,
and to say it sitting down and rising up, and going and coming, on all
their ways, and teach it to their children. "Thy praise shall be
always in my mouth." "Pray without ceasing." "Whosoever shall call
upon the name of the Lord shall be saved."

      The practice of repetitive prayer seems to have come to us from
the beginning of prayer in the world, from the time when men first began
to reach out toward God.

      After I read **The Way of a Pilgrim**, everything I read on prayer
seemed to point this same way, to urge along this same path.

      In my twenty-seven years as a Catholic I have found very few
priests teaching us how to pray, that is techniques of prayer. It is as
though with the recitation of the rosary, at high speed, or the saying
of  some of the Office (urged by those in what is termed the liturgical
movement) our teaching on prayers came to an end. Outstanding exceptions
like Fr. Louis Farina of the Pittsburgh diocese, and Fr. Wendell, O.P.
come to mind, but generally, if one asked a priest, "Father, teach me
to pray", we would be recommended the rosary or the Office. "Pray with
the Church. This is the greatest prayer there is." Of course Catholics
understand they must say their morning and evening prayers, make the
morning offering, the particular examen in addition, and there are
novena prayers, and many other devotions, multiplied beyond number until
often they become a burden. But the pruned down, utterly simple prayer
of the heart, the Jesus prayer, - this I learned through **The Way of a
Pilgrim**.
      Here is the story of the Pilgrim. When he was two and his brother
ten years old, they were left orphans and adopted by their pious
grandfather. The older brother used to love to run around the village
and get into scrapes, but the little child went with his grandfather to
Church and listened to the Bible being read. When he was seven years old
and his brother fifteen, and already taken to drink, the older boy
pushed him off the stove where they slept and injured his arm so badly
that he was never able to use it again. Seeing that he would not be fit
to work in the fields, his grandfather taught him to read from the
Bible, pointing out the letters and words to him. Later on a clerk who
used to come to the inn kept by the grandfather, taught him to write.
The old grandfather then said, "God has granted you the gift of
learning; it will make a man of you, give thanks to God and pray often."
When he was seventeen, his grandfather found him a wife, so the two of
them could help at the inn, and when he died, he left it to them
together with a little money he had saved. This aroused the jealousy of
the brother, who stole the money, set fire to the house and ran away,
leaving the young couple destitute.

      So they borrowed, built a hut and began to live as landless
peasants. The wife knitted and spun and sewed and people gave her jobs
and she took care of her husband, and while she spun, he would sit and
read her the Bible. They often fasted and every night they said many
prayers, making many prostrations. Although we had no idea of the
inner, heart acted prayer, but prayed with our lips only and made
senseless prostrations, turning somersaults like fools, we nevertheless
felt the desire for prayer, and the long ones we recited without
understanding did not seem tiring; quite the contrary we enjoyed
them a great deal. It must be true, as a certain teacher once told me,
that secret prayer is hidden deeply in the heart of man, though he may
not know about it. Yet, it acts mysteriously within his soul and prompts
him to pray according to his power and knowledge."

      After two years of this life of poverty and labor, the wife
suddenly was taken ill with a fever and died and the husband was left
entirely  alone. He was so grief stricken that he did not know what to do with
himself. When he went into his little hut and caught sight of her
clothes, or a scarf he burst into tears and even fell down in a faint.
So he sold the hut for twenty roubles and gave away his wife's clothes
to the poor, and set out with nothing but his Bible on his long
pilgrimage, from Kiev to Tobolsk and from Odessa to Archangel.

      It not known how the story came to be written, except that it was
put down under obedience, and the manuscript finally came into the hands
of a monk on Mount Athos, in whose possession it was found by the Abbot
of St. Michael's monastery at Kazan. The Abbot copied the manuscript
and from his copy the book was printed at Kazan in 1884.

      The Reverend R. M. French found a copy in the possession of
friends in Denmark and Bulgaria and made a translation which was printed
by the Society for the Promotion of Christian Knowledge in England in
1930.

      The story begins: By the grace of God I am a Christian, by my
deeds a great sinner, and by calling a homeless rover of the lowest
status in life. My possessions comprise but some rusk in a knapsack on
my back, and the Holy Bible on my bosom.

     "On the twenty-fourth Sunday after Pentecost, I went to church
to hear Mass. The first Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians was
read. In it we are exhorted, among other things, to "pray
incessantly", and these words engraved themselves upon my mind. I began
to ponder whether it is possible to pray without ceasing, since every
man must occupy himself with other things needed for his support. I
found this text in my Bible and read with my own eyes what I had heard,
namely that we must pray incessantly in all places, pray always in
spirit, lifting up our hand in devotion. I pondered and pondered and did
not know what to think of it.

      "What am I to do?" I mused. "Where will I be able to find
someone who can explain it to me? I shall go to the churches known for
their famous preachers; perhaps there I shall hear something that will
enlighten me."

      There is always something fascinating about the story of a search,
whether it is for a lost person, a treasure, a scientific discovery, or
an idea. And this story of a search for the secret "praying without
ceasing" is no exception.

      I thought as I read how unwilling we are, we Americans, in this
day, to look for a spiritual guide or a teacher. The Pilgrim's hunt
was rewarded. He found his teacher, after a good deal of wandering and
questioning. I must confess that some of the answer he received about
praying without ceasing would have satisfied me so that I would not have
looked any longer, but it was for something far simpler that the pilgrim
was searching. When he found his "staretz" and heard his answer he
knew at once that his search was ended.

      At the same time that he taught his disciple to pray, the monk
gave him a copy of the Philokalia which contained the writings of twenty
five holy fathers, including St. Gregory of Sinai, St. Callistus and St.
Ignatius.

      "We read passages of St. Gregory of Sinai, St. Callistus and St.
Ignatius and he interpreted them to me in his own words. I listened to
him attentively, overwhelmed with gladness, and did my best to store
every detail in my memory. Thus we stayed up the whole night together
and went to Matins without having slept at all."

      Hospitality was only offered for three days at the guest house of
the monastery so the pilgrim found work for a peasant, looking after his
kitchen garden who gave him a little thatched hut to live in. At first
the constant repetition of the prayer tired him very much and he
confessed he felt lazy and bored and overwhelmingly sleepy and a cloud
of all sorts of other thoughts closed round him. He went to his guide
and was reassured. The world of darkness hates prayer and the Enemy will
do everything to turn people from it. He urged the pilgrim to
persevere. "Whether you sit or stand, walk or lie down,
constantly repeat: Lord Jesus Christ have mercy on me."

      "Keep to yourself, get up early, go to bed later than usual,
and come to me for advice twice a month."

     "And now, I was wandering about repeating incessantly the prayer
of Jesus. To me it has greater value than anything else on earth.
Occasionally I walked seventy versts (43 miles) and do not fell it at
all. When bitter cold pierces me, I say it more eagerly and warm up
in no time."

      When I am hungry I begin to call on the name of Jesus more often
and forget about food. When I am ill and rheumatic pains set in my back
and legs, I concentrate on the Prayer and no longer notice the
discomfort. When people do wrong, my wrath and indignation are quickly
forgotten as soon as I remember the sweetness of the prayer of Jesus. When I am doing this I am filled with joy."

      I well know the objections that can be made to counting and
multiplying prayers. They have been made always to the rosary and seldom
a week passes that I do not meet someone who voices an objection to the
rosary on the grounds of senseless repetition.

      The words of Sister Madeleva in one of her poems comes to my mind.
The soul is talking to God, and asking if He does not weary of the
repetition, and God replies, "Doth it not irk me that upon the beach,
the tides monotonous run? Shall I not teach the sea some newer speech?"

      But the very fact of repetition means that the will is directed to
God, that there is an attempt to practice the presence of God. The sense
of strain that may at first come with it is no reason for giving up. To
begin the scales in music, to painstakingly learn to type, - to do any\
 handicraft when the fingers are unused to it, is at first difficult and
clumsy, and accompanied with strain.

      The litanies are an example of repetition in prayer and they are
of incomparable beauty. I remember waking up in Los Angeles to hear a
bird singing outside my window and the tune was that of the litany,
**-** **ora pro nobis, ora pro nobis** **-** the single refrain repeated
over and over again.

      The song of the three children,  "All ye works of the Lord, bless
ye the Lord, praise Him and magnify Him forever," is repeated prayer and
the exultation of that song has come down through the ages. It does seem
that repeated prayer, this prayer of the heart, is an older and simpler
form of prayer, the kind of prayer which holds up the heart and spirit
through weary night watches, in times of grave trouble when one is too
weary, too distracted to do anything but cry out, **Jesus, Jesus,
Jesus**. The Jesus psalter is another example.

      "Lord teach us to pray", we keep on saying with the apostles.
And often we reach the end of our lives without having learned.

      I am not venturing to review the Philokalis. It is enough for me
to introduce the readers of **The Third Hour**, to those who do not
already know it, to **The Way of a Pilgrim**.

      As for the matter of "breathing", St. Simeon taught "Sit
down alone and in silence. Lower your head, shut your eyes, breathe out
gently and imagine yourself looking into your own heart. As you breathe
out, say "Lord Jesus Christ, have mercy on me." Say it moving your
lips gently, or simply say it in your mind. Try to put all other
thoughts aside. Be calm, be patient, and repeat the process very
frequently."

      When Paul Claudel alluded to the matter of breathing he wrote, in
**Teach us to Pray**, "The discipline I propose involves no dwindling
of their being, on the contrary by *dint of full and deep breathing*
causing the oxygen to burn up the carbonic acid, it brings about a
prodigious acceleration and expansion of our vital rhythm, a renewal of
your whole being which helps us to understand what is meant by being
born again. We only need to open ourselves afresh to the breathe that
created us; and grace, reinforcing our nature, is ready to help us carry
out the injunction from Deuteronomy. In the complete giving of ourselves
to God it is not a corpse we are offering Him. Love is not merely a
yielding, it is our whole being yearning as in the famous passage,
'His left hand under my head and his right hand shall embrace me.'
God is not only Love, he is energy too. My father worketh till now and
I work."

      It is a work, this business of praying, and for us who are engaged
in the corporal works of mercy and the work of earning our living by the
sweat of our brow so that we feel we have no time to pray, such teaching
is a Godsend.

      We may not be able to go out like the Pilgrim with knapsack on our
backs, with two books and some loaves of bread and walk our 
 forty miles a day. It sounds idyllic, such a pilgrimage, but the heat
and dust and sweat and the torment of insects, the pangs of hunger and
thirst, - all these distractions go with a pilgrimage. Our riding on
subways, packed amidst sweating humanity sitting with aching back and
cramped muscles, climbing interminable stairs, - all the journeyings
commuters do in the rush of daily life, can be the penance which waters
prayer.

      I have been writing this in the midst of the care of five children
and the cooking of meals and washing of clothes and the attending to the
comings and goings of people in our hospice, and I can testify to the
joy and peace even the remembrance of such prayer gives, let alone the
practice of it.

notice of a little book*, On the Prayer of Jesus*, a collection of
writings from the ascetic essays of Bishop Ignatius Brianchaninov,
published in 1952 by John L. Warkins. This pure unwandering prayer of
the heart, this prayer of Jesus, had already come to my attention in the
shape of *The Way of a Pilgrim*, which I read and reread with that
delight that meets the discovery of a classic.
