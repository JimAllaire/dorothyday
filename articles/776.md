Dear Sir:

This office is in receipt of your communication dated October 24, 1960,
together with a copy of a letter addressed to the City Treasurer by
Dorothy Day, the Editor of the Catholic Worker requesting information
with respect to the disposition of the check in the sum of $3,579.39
which she returned to the City and which represents interest on an award
made to Dorothy Day in connection with the above captioned Parcels.

Please be advised that the money has been deposited in an account marked
"Sales of City Properly formerly held by Board of Transportation," and
will be utilized in the future for the purpose of acquiring property in
the public interest.

Should you within the near future desire the return of the aforesaid
monies, as interest, application therefore may be entertained pursuant,
to the provision Section 93-d of the New York City Charter.

Very truly yours,  
Jacob Goldman  
Chief, Division of Law

RE; Damage Parcel No. 8  
9 Section 2 Block 427, f  
Lot 35, 36 Manhattan  
Dear Jacob Goldman,

Thank you very much for your very kind and courteous letter addressed to
Charles Butterworth, III, and since there is a notation on the top
saying, "in replying refer to Law'", I might say in parenthesis that Mr.
Butterworth is a graduate of the Harvard Law School, as well as being
one of the editors of The Catholic Worker. You say in your letter that
in regard to Damage Parcel No. 8 and 9 Section 2 Block 427, Lot 35, 36
(Manhattan) you advise us that the money deposited, our income check of
$3,579.39 "will be utilized in the future for the purpose of acquiring
property in the public interest". We thank you very much for your
generous, offer to return the aforesaid monies, but the letter which Mr.
Butterworth wrote to you was prompted not only by the desire to know to
what use the money would be put but also to add a suggestion which I
hope you will not think presumptuous. It is rather frightening to think
of your acquiring any more property and dispossessing any more people,
no matter how noble your purpose. It would make us very happy indeed if
the interest money could be donated to the WNYC radio station which
provides such joy to so many. We appreciate certainly all the
information services and classical music and the broadcasts from the UN.

Gratefully yours in Christ,  
Dorothy Day  
Editor, The Catholic Worker
