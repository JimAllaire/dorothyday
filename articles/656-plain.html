<p>Large St.&#160;Andrew Daily Missal, by Dom Gaspar Lefebre, O.S.B., with vespers for Sundays and feasts. E. M. Lohmann Co., St.&#160;Paul, Minn. Cheapest binding, $6.25. Reviewed by Dorothy Day.</p>
<p>We have tried all kinds of missals, but this, with its Kyriale, the music of half a dozen Gregorian Masses, and innumerable hymns, its copious notes and lives of the saints, is a veritable encyclopedia for the layman. Throughout there is new and larger type, the ritual has been enlarged especially with the addition of the liturgy for the sick, proper feasts for the dioceses of the United States, and new Masses such as that of Saint Marie Goretti and Saint Louise de Marillac, The Mass for the feast of the Assumption, and the Easter Vigil. It is always good to keep remembering that as we learn in the catechism the purpose of our lives is to know, love and serve God. Certainly this new edition, presented so attractively, will help us grow in the knowledge of God, so that we may love and serve him better. Our first service is worship, adoration, and here we learn how, with the saints, with the seasons, to adore, praise, and thank God.</p>
