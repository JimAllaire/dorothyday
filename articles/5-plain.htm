<h1>On Pilgrimage</h1> 
<p>By Dorothy Day</p>

<p>Grand Rapids, Michigan: William B. Eerdmans, 1999.</p>
<p><em>Summary: States the objectives of the C.W. and defends it against the accusations of other Catholics and secular thought. Writes on such themes as marriage, sex, 10VQ&#8217; human condition, poverty, economics and a variety of Church doctrines. All of these topics are treated from an orthodox Catholic point of view. The book is adapted from the diary she kept in 1948, when she spent the first four months with Tamar (daughter) and the rest of the year at Mott street and the retreat farm in Newburgh. She noted that the book could be called a woman&#8217;s book, since parts of it are directed solely to women. As usual, much of the book dwells on the day to day happenings in her life.
