*The Catholic Worker*, February 1962, 6.

*Summary: Brief notice that her column will be missing while she works
on a new book. Slips in an emergency appeal. (DDLW \#790).*

I am working for the next three months on my new book, for Harper's,
which will emphasize Peter Maurin and the work which resulted from his
ideas and which will tell of the people who worked with him, the houses
of hospitality around the United States, and the attempts at farming
communes, also accounts of those associated with the work, who have
helped in the work, priests and laymen.

There will be no On Pilgrimage column for the next few issues, perhaps
even until Fall.

There is a good staff to get out the paper, and Jim Forest will be
responsible for that. There are plenty to answer letters, Judith
Gregory, Charles Butterworth, Walter Kerrell, Ed Forand and inquiries
can be addressed to them. Joe Motyka fills orders and takes care of new
subscribers. Charles Butterworth and Ed Forand take care of the funds,
such as they are. Right now they are nil, since we are in the mid-winter
doldrums and the next appeal will not come out until the end of March or
the first of April. But our eyes turn to Thee, O Lord, and "Thou givest
them food in due season. Thou openest Thy hand and with benevolence
fillest every living thing." There is also the matter of the rents, over
a thousand dollars a month for the apartments, ten of them, and the
house on Chrystie Street. We are begging our patron St.Â Joseph to remind
our Lord of that. And remind you, too.
