<p><em>Summary: A tender reminiscence of Stanley Vishnewski, the first to join her after she met Peter Maurin. Recalls how he saved her life, his companionship, generosity, and those who delighted in him. &#8220;I miss Stanley.&#8221; (DDLW #601).</em></p>
<p>A dear friend of mine who had no particular faith said in his last illness, &quot;Don&#8217;t mourn for me. But play, on the phonograph, Strauss&#8217;s <strong>Death and Transfiguration,</strong> and recite as a prayer the twenty-third psalm, <strong>The Lord is My Shepherd.&quot;</strong></p>
<p>I think of that as I mourn for Stanley. I can&#8217;t help but mourn. I miss him.</p>
<p>Stanley was the first Catholic Worker to arrive after my meeting with Peter Maurin. He was a seventeen-year-old Lithuanian from Brooklyn, and it was in the Depression, the early-thirties. (His name was really Stanislaus Vishnaukas, but in the Brooklyn school he first went to they found it difficult to pronounce and changed it to Stanley Vishnewski. I personally knew only one of the family, &#8220;Little Walty,&#8221; who was much bigger than Stanley. He, or still another brother, worked in a vast steel mill in Baltimore which I visited once. Their father was a tailor, and clothed his children well.) The first issue of <strong>The Catholic Worker</strong> had come out &#8211; a few thousand copies. Stanley&#8217;s version of our meeting was that he had met this &#8220;little, old lady&#8221; (I was in my mid-thirties) carrying a typewriter and with knightly gallantry, had offered to carry my burden. That was the beginning of a long association.</p>
<p>He had, indeed, all but saved my life on two different occasions. The first was during the National Biscuit Company strike when mounted policeman were called out to disperse a mass picket line. I had been distributing leaflets about the right to organize, and Stanley was helping me, when one of the police on a huge horse all but pressed me against a wall. Stanley got between me and the horse and its rider. The second time was when a crazed veteran, who had smuggled food into Biafra, Africa and who went &#8220;out of his mind&#8221; occasionally, stalked down the long hall at Tivoli, passed Stanley&#8217;s room, and came and threw himself on my bed, burying his face on my shoulder to weep. I could only gasp&#8211;&#8220;I am not your mother and you are very heavy!&#8221; But Stanley was right there in an instant to place a strong hand on his shoulder and say &#8211;&#8220;The dinner bell just rang.&#8221; This seemed to bring normalcy to a tense situation, and later the man&#8217;s friends came after him.</p>
<p>Stanley used to come, these recent years, and have dinner with me every evening, and we watched the television. He loved long walks &#8211; especially along Fourth Avenue, where second-hand book shops abound. Many a book he found for me to read or re-read.</p>
<p>And then, the sudden announcement &#8211; &#8220;Stanley is dead!&#8221;</p>
<p>Since he, himself, had a bad heart attack some years ago, he was living in Maryhouse, down the hall from my room. He was like an official guest master and delighted in taking new, out-of-town volunteers on walks. He had gone on many a speaking trip these last years, and the little, crippled children at Dorothy Gauchat&#8217;s Our Lady of the Wayside loved him (as adult audiences did, too). He had a marvelous slide show of the Catholic Worker history over the years. And his famous story, too, about the hungry lion, delighted old and young. I miss Stanley.</p>
