*The Catholic Worker*, January 1937, 5.

*Summary: The *Daily Worker*, a Communist daily paper, telegraphs *The
Catholic Worker* asking it to denounce "fascist barbarism." The response
protests all war, imperialist, civil, or class, whether fascist or
bolshevist. (DDLW \#313).*

A few days before Christmas we received the following telegram from the
Daily Worker, Communist newspaper:

WOULD APPRECIATE RECEIVING FIFTY WORD CHRISTMAS MESSAGE BY WEDNESDAY
EVENING COLLECT VIA WESTERN UNION DIRECTED AGAINST FASCIST BARBARISM,
ASSAULT ON RELIGIOUS FREEDOM, AND THREAT TO WORLD PEACE. DAILY WORKER
DESIRES TO CONTRIBUTE TOWARD A CHRISTMAS SPIRIT BUILT ON DEMOCRACY AND
PEACE.

C.A. HATHAWAY, Editor.

Anxious to oblige, we sent back the following telegram, collect:

CATHOLIC WORKER JOINS IN APPEAL FOR DEMOCRACY AND PEACE, THEREFORE ASKS
YOU TO JOIN PROTEST AGAINST ALL DICTATORSHIPS, FASCIST AND BOLSHEVIST,

AGAINST ALL WAR, WHETHER IMPERIALIST, CIVIL, OR CLASS. MERRY CHRISTMAS.

DOROTHY DAY, Editor.
