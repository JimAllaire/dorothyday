         <p><em>The Catholic Worker</em>, July/August 1960, p.&#160;5.</p>
         <p><em>Summary: Explains the lack of a full column due to the birth of her latest granddaughter. (DDLW #949).</em></p>
         <p>Nothing can be more engrossing than taking care of children, and this month has been a busy one both on Staten Island, on the beach, and at Perkinsville, Vermont, where a new child, Catherine Ann, was born to David and Tamar Hennessy on July 9, instead of on July 24 when she was expected. Not only did I not write a continuation of my travels which I promised for this issue, but I wrote no &#8220;on pilgrimage&#8221; at all. Instead, I wrote a review of the one play I saw, &#8220;The Connection&#8221; and an account of the one Friday evening meeting I attended at which Fritz Eichenberg spoke. In the September issue, the &#8220;On Pilgrimage&#8221; will be continued.</p>
