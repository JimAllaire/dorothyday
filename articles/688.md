% Help Needed This Summer For Puerto Rican Camp

*Summary: Appeals to readers for money to assist children from East
Harlem to spend a summer at the beach. (DDLW \#688).*

Again this summer Helen Russell, Mary Anne McCoy and Eileen Fantino are
trying to take some of the Puerto Rican children in their neighborhood
of East Harlem to the beach for the summer. What we would like to do is
to rent a beach bungalow or obtain the use of some other camping
facilities, so that the children could spend all their time on the beach
in the sun and sea air. We are begging our readers who have children of
their own and who realize what slum life is and who want to do something
about it, to send contributions for this project to these girls who are
living as close as they can to these most needy of our city's poor folk.

Those of you who read my story of Felicia, those of you who have read
Eileen Fantino's stories of the Puerto Ricans (the most recent is an
article in the Commonweal for June 11^th^) know how urgent is the need.

Any beach bungalow will cost about \$500 for the summer. Please help. As
for the food, we'll think about that later. "A baby is always born with
a oaf of bread under its arm," the Spanish saying is. If they ask Our
Father for bread, he won't give them a stone. D.D.
