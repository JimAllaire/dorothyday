<p><em>The Catholic Worker</em>, December 1933, 2.</p>
<p><em>Summary: Distinguishes <em>The Catholic Worker</em> from other news publications: &#8220;The purpose of a paper is to influence the thought of its readers. We are quite frankly propagandists for Catholic Action.&#8221; (DDLW #198).</em></p>
<p>Father Gratry says that reading newspapers is a waste of time. One loses sight of the eternal. (But we hope you won&#8217;t take this to mean that reading THE CATHOLIC WORKER is a waste of time.)</p>
<p>After reading the <em>New York Times</em>, the <em>Daily Worker</em>, the <em>Federated Press</em>, the N.A.A.C.P. new service, the N.C.W.C. news service, <em>America</em>, the <em>Commonweal</em>, the <em>Sign</em>, the <em>Nation</em>, <em>The New Republic</em>, etc., etc., we bring out a December issue which only glancingly touches on such news as the recent lynchings, codes, sweat shops, housing problems and other news which demands critical comment.</p>
<p>Father Corbett came in to see us a couple of times last month. One day he came in to converse, and another day to criticize, and he left his ear phones off the second day, lest, I suppose, &#8220;we justify ourselves in our sins.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;People say that you do too much criticizing,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and don&#8217;t point out all that is being done.&#8221;</p>
<p>We agree that much is being done&#8211;but so much more remains. &#8220;Never rest, never rest, there&#8217;s no peace on earth,&#8221; we say cheerfully with our patron saint of Teresa of Avila.</p>
<p>Hence we give much space this issue to detail plans and discuss Houses of Hospitality, our recent Round Table Discussion, ideas for a Catholic Workers&#8217; School.</p>
<p>We are not giving you news such as you get in your daily paper. We are giving you ideas as to Catholic Action. We touch lightly on the hotel worker&#8217;s code, because hotel employees have come into the office and told us of the conditions under which they work.</p>
<p>We describe conditions of factory work for girls, because it shows the inefficacy of depending on codes (regulation) as compared to working for a renewal of the Christian spirit. Our date-packing story also shows the need of Houses of Hospitality for women workers at such wages.</p>
<p>The purpose of a paper is to influence the thought of its readers. We are quite frankly propagandists for Catholic Action.</p>
<p>&#8220;You may think you are newspaper editors,&#8221; Father Parsons, the editor of &#8220;America,&#8221; said a few months ago in friendly comment. &#8220;But agitators is what you really are.&#8221;</p>
