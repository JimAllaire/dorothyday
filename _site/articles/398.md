and self-discipline. Says Jesus was not nationalistic, appreciates the

Meditations On Our Times
===

Pius XII asked us on the feast of the Immaculate Conception to love our
enemies; to overcome the spirit of hatred and revenge.

1.	Love is the measure by which we shall be judged. **St. John of the
Cross.**

2.	Hell is not to love any more. **Bernanos.**

3. We can only show our love for God by our love for our fellows. **St.
Teresa.**

4. How can we love God whom we do not see, if we do not love our fellow
human beings whom we see? **St. John.**

5. Love is a choice, a preference exercised by the will, **diligo**, so
we can be commanded to love, to make choice of, to prefer God to all
things. **Bede Frost.**

6. The soul that walks in love wearies not, neither is wearied. Love
consists not in feeling great things, but in great detachment from
things and suffering for the Beloved. **St. John of the Cross.**

7. Love is that of a bride for her husband. Consider the Canticle of
Canticles.

8.	I love God as much as I love the one I love the least. **Fr. Hugo**,
quoting.

9.	Love in practice is a harsh and dreadful thing compared to love in
dreams. Dostoievsky.

10.	To offer the other cheek, to love your neighbor as yourself, not
because it pays to do so, but because it is a joy--to love him with
fiery emotion, with passion! (The Journal of an Author, Dostoievsky).

Jesus Was Not Class Conscious
===

During the Spanish Civil War the communists said, "We will not destroy
that statue of Jesus because he is ours."

When St. John was put in prison by Herod, did our Lord protest? Did He
form a defense committee? Did He collect funds, stir up public opinion?
Did He try to get him out?

Jesus Was Not Nationalistic
===

Did He denounce the Vichy men of his day? These were the publicans, who
collected taxes for the Romans, such as Matthew and Zacchaeus. First as
He came along the road from Jericho to Jerusalem, He healed two blind
men and was praised by the multitude. Then He saw Zacchaeus in the
sycamore tree and invited Himself to stay at his house; at this the
multitude complained of Him. One Sunday he entered Jerusalem as a King.
The following Friday he was crucified by the very multitude who
acclaimed him. The Church that goes with the state today will be
crucified by the state tomorrow. Do we not have to share with the Head,
His fate?

Jesus did not try to free the oppressed people of Israel. He did not
protest the killing of the Galileans in the Temple by the Roman
soldiers. His kingdom was not of this world. He told Peter to put up his
sword. He did not bless scrap iron in Churchyards.

Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees. Remember, too, the publicans can
also say, "Thank God I am not as the Pharisees." (Maureen Egan's
poem in the Torch, Nov., 1943.) Jesus loved publicans and sinners, He
loved His enemies. He loved even those who crucified Him. The Liberty of
Christ that St. Paul talks so much about was not liberty of the body
when Jesus hung on the cross.

The Others
===

Charles Peguy wrote: "I am afraid to go to Heaven alone. God will say
to me, 'Where are the others?'"

In one sense we live and die alone in an awful solitude. But, joyful
thought, we are all members one of another, members of the same body and
our Head is Jesus Christ. The last encyclical of our dear sweet Christ
on earth is on the Mystical Body. (You can get it and read it, as who
would not wish to read every word written by Pius XII? America Press in
New York puts it out, and so does the N.C.W.C. in Washington.)

Here, too, is the idea of the communion of saints. "When the health of
one member suffers, the health of the whole body is lowered." And
contrariwise, if one is uplifted, he lifts others with him. We share in
the honor and glory and beauty and love of others. We can draw upon
their merits. We are inspired by their example. We are followers of
Christ, our Head.

We Put On Christ
===

St. Paul said, to put off the old man and put on Christ. Poverty is no
good supernaturally if it is a pagan poverty for the sake of the freedom
involved, though that is good, naturally speaking. Poverty is good,
because we share the poverty of others, we know them and so love them
more. Also, by embracing poverty we can give away to others. If we eat
less, others can have more. If we pay less rent, we can pay the rent of
a dispossessed family. If we go with old clothes, we can clothe others.
We can perform the corporal works of mercy by embracing poverty.

If we embrace poverty we put on Christ. If we put off the world, if we
put the world out of our hearts, there is room for Christ within.

Solitude is no good unless it is "to be still and see that I am
God." God said, "It is not good for man to live alone." But
occasionally Jesus calls and says, "Let us go apart and rest
awhile." By this practice of solitude, one can learn to put the world
out, to put on Christ.

One has to practice loving one's neighbor, seeing Christ in one's neighbor.

But a Hundredfold
===

To put off the old man means putting off useless reading, much of our
newspaper reading, books, movies. This is mortifying the eyes. Making
them dead to the world so we can see the true light which is Christ.
(The hundredfold reward.)

(This morning the moon was setting at 6 o'clock--large, radiant,
joyful behind the bare black branches of the maples. "I have loved O
Lord the beauty of Thy house, the place where thy glory dwelleth." The
star of morn to night succeeds.

The ears. Idle talk. The radio. The world comes into the ears.
Suspicion, rancour, hatred, fear, come in through the ears. Perhaps I
can learn to control by tongue, practice silence, if I control my ears.
This means giving up the good with the bad, music, opera. But, again, we
can't help ourselves, there is that hundredfold. The very birds down
here, starlings, sparrows, even the hoarse crow, and in the convent the
other morning the so sweet singing to our Lady.)

Touch. The pleasures and pains of sense are confused. In Koestler's
latest book, "Arrival and Departure," this is very plain. In the
book the psychoanalyst told him he was doing penance. The idea is
strongly brought out that everyone feels a sense of guilt these days.
Ernie Pyle, in the World-Telegram, brought that out the other day. The
world has this sense of the Mystical Body. So has the Communist. But how
blindly they feel it, poor sheep without a shepherd. The intellectuals
shout Fascist every time the Pope speaks. Having eyes they see not,
ears, and they hear not.

Christ offered His death for the sins of the world. So we offer our
voluntary and involuntary pains and sufferings for the sins of the
world, my own and others. Accepting gladly, joyously, by no matter who
inflicted. To pray with outstretched arms, to keep vigil when the whole
body is tortured with the desire for sleep, to scourge oneself, to fast.

A German woman doctor who spent a year in a concentration camp for
refusing to sterilize epileptics, said that one form of torture
inflicted was to turn blinding light into the cells so that the women
could not sleep. This is to be keeping vigil with Christ. To keep vigil
voluntarily is to be sharing this pain of the world, this agony of the
Mystical Body. Insomnia may be keeping vigil.

Training to Forgive
===

To train oneself for the race, to train oneself to a joyful acceptance,
a loving acceptance. To love one's enemies.

"Father, forgive them for they know not what they do."

Jesus said to a fellow-sufferer, who accepted his pains, This day
shalt thou be with Me in Paradise.

St. Peter said, not long after the death of Jesus, "And now brothers,
comrades, I know that you acted in ignorance, as did also your rulers.
Repent then and be converted." What hope! What optimism! What
foolishness. It is the folly of the cross. Can a Hitler be converted and
live? God, I believe, help thou mine unbelief. Let me see Christ in Him.
Take away my heart of stone, and give me a heart of flesh. Teach me to
love.

Help me, Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews, have mercy on me, a
sinner. Help me to make a tiny beginning at building up that great and
mighty force of love which will overcome Fear.

How mighty is that force. How terrible and beautiful a thing it is to
fall into the hands of a living God. Teach us, God, Holy and Mighty one,
what Love is!
