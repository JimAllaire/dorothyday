Nothing can be more engrossing than taking care of children, and this
month has been a busy one both on Staten Island, on the beach, and at
Perkinsville, Vermont, where a new child, Catherine Ann, was born to
David and Tamar Hennessy on July 9, instead of on July 24 when she was
expected. Not only did I not write a continuation of my travels which I
promised for this issue, but I wrote no "on pilgrimage" at all. Instead,
I wrote a review of the one play I saw, "The Connection" and an account
of the one Friday evening meeting I attended at which Fritz Eichenberg
spoke. In the September issue, the "On Pilgrimage" will be continued.
