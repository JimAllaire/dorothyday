<h1>Communists Communicate</h1> 
<p>By Dorothy Day</p>

<p><em>The Catholic Worker</em>, January 1937, 5.</p>
<p>*Summary: The <em>Daily Worker</em>, a Communist daily paper, telegraphs <em>The Catholic Worker</em> asking it to denounce &#8220;fascist barbarism.&#8221; The response protests all war, imperialist, civil, or class, whether fascist or bolshevist. (DDLW #313).*</p>
<p>A few days before Christmas we received the following telegram from the Daily Worker, Communist newspaper:</p>
<p>WOULD APPRECIATE RECEIVING FIFTY WORD CHRISTMAS MESSAGE BY WEDNESDAY EVENING COLLECT VIA WESTERN UNION DIRECTED AGAINST FASCIST BARBARISM, ASSAULT ON RELIGIOUS FREEDOM, AND THREAT TO WORLD PEACE. DAILY WORKER DESIRES TO CONTRIBUTE TOWARD A CHRISTMAS SPIRIT BUILT ON DEMOCRACY AND PEACE.</p>
<p>C.A. HATHAWAY, Editor.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>Anxious to oblige, we sent back the following telegram, collect:</p>
<p>CATHOLIC WORKER JOINS IN APPEAL FOR DEMOCRACY AND PEACE, THEREFORE ASKS YOU TO JOIN PROTEST AGAINST ALL DICTATORSHIPS, FASCIST AND BOLSHEVIST, AGAINST ALL SUPPRESSION OF CIVIL LIBERTIES, FASCIST AND BOLSHEVIST, INCLUDING FREEDOM OF RELIGIOUS PROPAGANDA, EDUCATION, AND ORGANIZATION, AGAINST ALL WAR, WHETHER IMPERIALIST, CIVIL, OR CLASS. MERRY CHRISTMAS.</p>
