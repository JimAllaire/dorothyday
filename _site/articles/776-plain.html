<p>THE CATHOLIC WORKER<br />39 SPRING STREET<br />NEW YORK 12, N Y<br />November 3, 1960</p>
<p>Mr, Jacob Goldman<br />Chief, Division of Law<br />The City Of New York<br />Office of the Comptroller<br />Municipal Building<br />New York 7, New York</p>
<p>RE; Damage Parcel No. 8<br />9 Section 2 Block 427, f<br />Lot 35, 36 Manhattan<br />Dear Jacob Goldman,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for your very kind and courteous letter addressed to Charles Butterworth, III, and since there is a notation on the top saying, &#8220;in replying refer to Law&#8217;&#8221;, I might say in parenthesis that Mr.&#160;Butterworth is a graduate of the Harvard Law School, as well as being one of the editors of The Catholic Worker. You say in your letter that in regard to Damage Parcel No. 8 and 9 Section 2 Block 427, Lot 35, 36 (Manhattan) you advise us that the money deposited, our income check of $3,579.39 &#8220;will be utilized in the future for the purpose of acquiring property in the public interest&#8221;. We thank you very much for your generous, offer to return the aforesaid monies, but the letter which Mr.&#160;Butterworth wrote to you was prompted not only by the desire to know to what use the money would be put but also to add a suggestion which I hope you will not think presumptuous. It is rather frightening to think of your acquiring any more property and dispossessing any more people, no matter how noble your purpose. It would make us very happy indeed if the interest money could be donated to the WNYC radio station which provides such joy to so many. We appreciate certainly all the information services and classical music and the broadcasts from the UN.</p>
<p>Gratefully yours in Christ,<br />Dorothy Day<br />Editor, The Catholic Worker</p>
