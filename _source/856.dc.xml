<dc:description>An appeal for money. Notes their hospitality for the families of migrants, for pickets in the grape boycott, and the many apartments they rent. "Even as I am writing this a woman comes to borrow twenty-five dollars. She does this every so often and it usually is a dire need."</dc:description>
