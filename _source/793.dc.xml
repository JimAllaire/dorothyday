<dc:description><P>Departs for Cuba to see for herself life under Castro's communism, especially farming communes, the life of the family, and religious freedom. Humorously comments on the 40 rules in fine print on her steamship ticket. Deflects critics who say she won't be truthful and see much. Reaffirms her pacifism even though Cuba "is an armed camp." " I will try to make the Cuban story come alive."</P></dc:description>
