<dc:source>1938, Chapter 4, pp. 37-50.</dc:source>
<dc:description>Recounts her loneliness and poverty at college as well as her conscious turn away from religion. Describes reading Upton Sinclair, Ignazio Silone, Kropotkin, Tolstoi, and Dostoevsky--the latter two allowing her to cling to faith in God. Her yearning grows to struggle with the masses. "Where were the saints to try to change the social order, not just to minister to the slaves but to do away with slavery?"</dc:description>
