<dc:description>Reviews her lecture-tour and visit to Catholic Worker groups begun on March 29<SUP>th</SUP> through Montreal; Baltimore, where she revisited acquaintances at St. Peter Claver's; Cincinnati; a lecture at a girls' school in nearby Kentucky and a visit to a state mental hospital; St. Louis where she renewed old friendships and was reminded of America's racial problems; Oklahoma City and a visit to a federal reformatory and St. Patrick's Guest House where she visited conscientious objectors. Muses how this journey is part of the work although she prefers settling down.</dc:description>
