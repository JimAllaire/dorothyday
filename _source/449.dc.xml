<dc:description>An account of struggling with agencies and suspicious police to find a room for a small child. A reflection of Christ's sufferings, borne for all who suffer now, and the realization that "suffering and death can no longer be victorious." Discusses the problem of dissension and self-criticism in the movement, reproaching herself and her own sinfulness. Notes how hard their work is and that change comes slowly. Asserts that "Love and ever more love is the only solution to every problem that comes up."</dc:description>
