<dc:description>Mediates on the Catholic Worker's mission to all the poor--including those who are deemed unworthy of assistance by some who blame the poor for their condition. Concludes the story of her Southern travels with observations on Alabama, Georgia, and South Carolina. Updates readers on the status of the women's Bayard Street shelter and the history behind Ade Bethune's illustrated Stations of the Cross.</dc:description>
