<dc:description>Graphic account of Mary Frecons work in a black section of Harrisburg, PA,--the spirited church services, the smell of rats, the care for the dying sick. Emphasizes the unity of body and soul and the need for "blind faith" in such conditions. "How little it all is, as obscure as the life of the Blessed Mother, and as 'little' as the life and sufferings of the Little Flower!" </dc:description>
