<dc:author>Dorothy Day</dc:author>
<dc:source>The Catholic Worker, November 1965, 1, 7.</dc:source>
<dc:description>Reflects on the self-immolation of Roger LaPorte as a protest against the Vietnam war. Discusses suicide doctrinally, psychologically, and in literature. Tries to understand his intentions and the need for protest in the midst of war and building for war. Speaks of the notion of the victim soul and why she prays for those who kill themselves.</dc:description>
