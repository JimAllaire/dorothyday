<dc:title>On Pilgrimage - July/August 1962</dc:title>
<dc:author>Dorothy Day</dc:author>
<dc:source>The Catholic Worker, July-August 1962, 2, 3.</dc:source>
<dc:description>Mentions her travails in getting a new book about the Catholic Worker movement, <I>Loaves and Fishes</I>, ready for the publisher. Disapproves of the attitudes and behavior of "a group of beats" who came and went, especially their sexual behavior and disrespect for the body. Hopes to travel to Brazil and Cuba. Recommends reading Chekhov and numerous other books.</dc:description>
