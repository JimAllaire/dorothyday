<dc:description>Asked to visit a woman committed to the psychopathic ward of Bellevue Hospital for an anti-Semitic remark, she recalls harrowing experiences with the mentally disturbed and tales of unjust incarcerations in psychiatric hospitals. These memories, plus an unpleasant encounter with one of Bellevue's doctors, prompts her interest in studying Belgium's decentralized methods for dealing with the mentally ill.</dc:description>
