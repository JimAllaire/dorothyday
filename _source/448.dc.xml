<dc:author>Dorothy Day</dc:author>
<dc:source>1939, Chapter Thirteen, pp. 225 - 242.</dc:source>
<dc:description>On speaking trips to California, Florida, and Alabama, she notes the many places she spoke to labor groups, the projects of many lay people, priests, and sisters, and a visit with the anti-union president of a steel mill. Describes the death and funeral of a seaman who lived at the Catholic Worker. Reiterates the principles of their work: smallness, giving shelter to the homeless, indoctrination, personal responsibility, teaching cooperation and mutual aid, and relying on God--"Unless the Lord build the house, they labor in vain that build it. Recommends several books.</dc:description>
