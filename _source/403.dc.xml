<dc:description>A "fictional" account of priests and workers, those who find the way and those who are led astray, all figure in this story of "all of us. . .myself and you." There is Father Joy who dislikes mortification and detachment. Father Cross speaks of the daily cross and the text "He who says he has done enough has already perished." We meet Minimus the drunk, Fabiola, a woman who enjoys find things, and Lefty who gives up everything for Christ.</dc:description>
