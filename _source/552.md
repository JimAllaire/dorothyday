*The Catholic Worker*, June 1975, 1, 2, 6.

*Summary: Vignettes from her date book--life at the beach house on
Staten Island, visitors, books she is reading, meetings attended, and
visits to Catholic Worker houses and her family. (DDLW \#552).*

The easiest way for me to write my piece this month is just to follow my
diary for the last month. When my sister and I were little girls, we
used to climb out after school on a breakwater on Lake Michigan, just
off Lincoln Park, and sit there surrounded by that inland sea and write
in our diaries. (Whatever became of them!)

Nowadays, I keep two diaries. One just a date book with large space for
extended notes, and the other an occasional one when I have a sense of
leisure, as at my sister's near Tivoli or my daughter's in Vermont. I
will follow the date book now. It is a mixed bag of notes on my winter
on the beach in Staten Island, an interim to recover from general
fatigue, and to catch up on mail and a book. (I don't remember the time
when I was **not** writing a book.)

**Sunday, May 4.** Pouring rain all day. Everything smells fresh. Waves are
pounding on the beach. Went to five-thirty Mass up at Holy Child Church
in Eltingville. There seems to be music at every Mass, a children's
choir and congregation joining in, and of every hymn, every verse is
sung. St Augustine wrote that a prayer sung is twice said. There is no
parochial school, but a school of religion for the children. There are
pamphlet and book racks, and a St. Vincent de Paul Society (very few of
**those** left what with our centralized charities). The priests are
Irish, Polish and Italian, and the sermons are very good. Food for
thought.

**Monday, May 5.** Sunny today. Walked on the beach and collected driftwood
for the pot-bellied stove. Storms have been so severe this winter that
all sorts of timber, remains of wrecked ships and piers, even huge
blocks of cement, portions of waterfront sidewalks, have been tossed up
by the waves that ate away part of the shoreline through the winter
months. And plenty of small scraps for the stove.

**Tuesday, May 6.** Answering mail for hours ... Reading the correspondence
of Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman, a fascinating account of the two
famous and lovable anarchists who were deported to Russia after the
First World War. With difficulty they left Russia, finding it too
oppressive. There story of their years in exile all over Europe is
called **Nowhere to Home (**Schocken Books, \$12.95). I had met Berkman
years ago after his release from prison. (Ammon Hennacy writes of him in
his own autobiography, of his meeting with him in the Federal Prison in
Atlanta, Ga. Ammon had a great admiration for Emma Goldman too.) My old
friend, Peggy Baird Cowley, with whom I shared a prison cell during the
woman's suffrage struggle in 1917 or '18, had given Berkman hospitality
after he did time in Atlanta, and Emily Coleman, write and poet, had
been Emma's secretary in Paris while Emma was writing her autobiography
(still in print, as is Berkman's prison memoirs). Both Peggy and Emily
became Catholics and ended their days with us at our Tivoli farm. Peter
Maurin was more interested in the philosophical anarchism of Peter
Kropotkin, with his constructive ideas set forth in **Mutual Aid,**and
**Fields, Factories and Workshops.** Kropotkin's **Memoirs of a
Revolutionist**was first printed in the **Atlantic Monthly**! His books
can be bought in paperback and in these times of highly centralized
authority, not to speak of corruption, it is good to read about these
freedom-fighters, and a vision of a decentralized society.

Honorable Work
--------------

**Tuesday, May 6.** Press day. May Day is an important date for us, since
our paper first came out May first in 1933. We have many writers and
many editors. But they are all so engaged in baking bread, making soup,
begging from the market, not to speak of taking care of St. Joseph's
House on First Street, that writing is always done at the last minute.
However, this May Day issue is a gem, covering all our positions and our
activities--what we are all about. Also, it is twelve instead of eight
pages.

How we pay our bills I do not know. God knows. Scripture tells us, if we
"sow sparingly we will we will reap sparingly," so when we are in need
we become more generous and serve an even richer soup to an ever growing
line. "Give to him to who asks"--we try to do that. Today it is a cold
day. There will be a run on the clothes room, an old store on Second
Avenue.

Down here on Staten Island, Augustino caught the first fish of the
season, a striped bass. He gave it to Marge Hughes to bake (she is
wintering next door but will soon return to West Virginia to the village
springing up there). She skinned the fish. I once spread out eel skins
on a board and dried them in the sun, and later made a beautiful binding
for a prayer book. A bit smelly, but I was reminded that Peter, James
and John were fisherman. "After the crucifixion, those apostles could go
back to their nets, but Matthew could not go back to his counting
house," Fr. Vincent McNabb, the famous English Dominican a writer, said.
Fishing is an honorable occupation!

**Friday, May 9.** I went in to New York to attend the Pax Christi Meeting
at which there were two bishops present, Bishop Dozier of Memphis and
Bishop Gumbleton of Detroit.

**Saturday, May 10.** The meeting lasted all day, and Tom Cornell drove me
downtown to Union Square in the late afternoon to join the United Farm
Worker's meeting which had begun with a parade down Seventh Avenue. It
was a beautiful day for the meeting and the joyful confidence of the
strikers continues. I hope they get plenty of volunteers for their
training courses which are carried on by Fred Ross, a brilliant
organizer who has been on their side from the first. I wish I could get
to the Farm Worker's headquarters at 331 W. 84th St., New York, New York
10024, to sit in on some of the sessions.

At Staten Island
----------------

**Monday, May 12.** Back to Staten Island. Johnny Hughes and Tommy Turner,
his cousin, found star fish and sea horses at low tide today on the
beach. It was fun to see them swim around upright. The larger ones,
which we picked up on the beach, were dead and dried up. I learned an
interesting fact. The female lays the eggs and the male has the
burdensome task of carrying them in a pouch (my informant says his
**stomach!**) until they hatch!

**Tuesday, May 13.** Dr. William Miller, historian from the University of
Florida who wrote **A Harsh and Dreadful Love,** (now in paperback in
the Image books of Doubleday, and originally published by Liveright),
arrived for a two-day visit. He is driving back to Florida with a
carload of manuscripts and note-books to help him complete his work on
Peter Maurin and the Catholic Worker movement. This should be an
invaluable help to all the young people who are starting Houses of
Hospitality around the country. His own sons and their college mates are
starting one in Tallahassee (At present there are about 47. I can not be
too sure of the number as there are many beginnings and unless we keep
in touch, we do not know how long they survive.) Every now and then we
have small epidemics of violence in our houses and neighborhoods, and
they are pretty hard to take unless there is a good supportive group.
Our windows get broken regularly, but since they are make up of many
small panes, they can be mended more easily. One of our fellow workers
who enjoys our evening meals, offered to paint vines all over the
cracked but reinforced panes, and his artistry resulted in a regular
Jack and the Beanstalk vine which wandered over the panes and spread
over the walls. And among the broad green leaves fluttered a number of
peaceable white pigeons! I always delighted in this working out
practically Peter Maurin's synthesis of Cult, Culture, and Cultivation.
Cult (religion) resulted in our bearing these affronts calmly without
resorting to violence in turn; Culture was increased thereby, a reminder
that the workman on a medieval cathedral also passed from cult to
culture; and, of course, the greenery as a whole reminded us of the
Cultivation which is going on not only among the little mountain farms
of West Virginia, but in Tivoli. When Harry Simmons, our "genius" of an
architect (as Ruth Collins, our co-worker on our House problems called
him), dropped in one evening, he liked our cheerful utilization of one
of the smaller of our daily disasters around St. Joseph's House.

**Thursday, May 15.** Marge is packing up to go to West Virginia, but
finding time to plant the garden in the little yard of one of the two
small houses which we have named St. John of the Cross, and St.Teresa of
Avila. They are the nearest thing we have for our young volunteers to
use as a Poustinia, which Catherine de Hueck Doherty of Combermere,
Canada, has introduced us to through her book by that name, published by
Notre Dame Press. Most of the winter I have lived in one and Marge
Hughes in the other with her son John. But now the winter has come to an
end, and I must go to the farm at Tivoli for a brief visit to Unity
Acres and Unity Kitchen in Syracuse.

**Friday, May 16.** Spent the day cleaning up, getting the little three-room
place ready for summer visitors. And always there are letters to write!
And temptations to read. I have been reading over Thomas Merton's four
long reviews of Indian civilizations which were originally printed in
the **Catholic Worker** and which are now going to come out in book
form. I am supposed to write the introduction. I feel utterly
inadequate. The reviews, really long articles, are inspiring to read and
one finishes them only to say, More, more,--we need to study more about
these peoples, these former great civilizations! Why do I say yes to
such assignments? Partly, it is my newspaper background where writing is
a daily job. But I here confess with a great sense of guilt, that this
last year I have agreed to write articles for a number of periodicals
and have not done so. We are too overwhelmed at The Catholic Worker. The
sufferings of so many of those with whom we live day after day, year
after year, weigh us down at times so that there is no energy to
adequately handle writing jobs. Just to live, to endure, and yes, to
rejoice too that God has given us a work to do, is enough. These little
houses should serve that purpose, to give us breathing space, time to
reflect, and to let go, drop out of activity for a time, leave the work
to others and to pray. Work enough!

Spring Visits
-------------

The rest of May. I did indeed visit around and enjoyed it very much.
Travel refreshes me. Reading Chekhov's letters, I find that he too, was
an ardent traveller. Nothing was too much for him. His long trip across
Siberia by river and by carriage to visit the Penal Colony of Sakhalin
(he hoped to alleviate the sufferings of the people there) and all his
letters to his family are fascinating reading. Both Viking Press and
Harpers have published volumes of his letters to his family, his
publishers and friends, and I have been reading them, and feeling
justified in starting out again as I am going to do the rest of this
month.

So to finish my report--I have visited Tivoli, and am preparing to go
back for much of the Peacemaker Conference the last two weeks of June. A
weekend with my sister at Kinderhook, New York. A few days in Syracuse,
where I visited Carol and Jerry Berrigan, and the mother of those
valiant sons who shared the sufferings of prisoners by their sentences
for destroying draft records. A good visit in Syracuse with the group
who help Fr. McVey in his great venture, Unity Acres, and then on to
Unity Acres itself, where probably two hundred and fifty men have been
given refuge in a beautiful tract of forest surrounding an old t.b.
hospital which was no longer being used. They are thirty or so miles
north of Syracuse and many of our men "off the road," as we say at
Tivoli, and many a one from St. Joseph's House in New York also have
found time to recover from illnesses of various kinds. As far as I know,
no limit is put on the time they can stay there.

I was sorry I did not get the chance to visit Unity Kitchen in Syracuse,
but the trouble is, one is taken possession of by one's friends. But I
saw the large building, which is like a three-story loft and houses the
dining room, a dormitory which can take care of thirty men, and a
clothing room and repair shop. I was much impressed. I also visited in
Rochester and was happy to find that the House of Hospitality is still
operating, serving food but not lodging. A monastery not too far away is
supplying the Rochester and Syracuse houses with bread daily for
hundreds of men--good monks bread.

And now I set out for a visit with my daughter up in Vermont. I have not
seen her for many months, as her hillside farm was covered with snow and
ice during a particularly hard winter. But now I will have the joy of
visiting with her and the grandchildren, and their children! On the long
bus trip today, I shall do much praying for them all, and for all those
I am leaving at home on First and Third Streets, and at Tivoli, who
continue the hard round of daily labors, and for our readers and
writers, and all those who break bread with us daily.
