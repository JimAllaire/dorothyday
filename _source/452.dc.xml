<dc:author>Dorothy Day</dc:author>
<dc:source>The Catholic Worker, March 1947, 2, 4.</dc:source>
<dc:description>Focuses on worker ownership and calls for workers to fight for the means of production, to shun working for the war effort, for priests to come out of their rectories to help the poor, and for all to start the struggle for reform of the social order and against charity growing cold. Repeats the need to be one with the poor and to resist the present social order.</dc:description>
