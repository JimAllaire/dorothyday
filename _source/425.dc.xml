<dc:description>In the face of a world in turmoil--atom bomb tests, food shortages, impending strikes, destitution--an exhortation to "love as Christ loved, to the extent of laying down our lives for our brothers." Tells of a priest whose work made him "a perfect fool for Christ." Says "we confess to being fools and wish we were more so."</dc:description>
