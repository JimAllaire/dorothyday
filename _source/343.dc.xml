<dc:description>An open letter to Peter Maurin telling him of the latest developments during one of his prolonged absences from the New York area. There were some tragedies--her father and Mr. Breen died and Charlie the bricklayer collapsed. Many members of the team fell ill. Yet there was also joy to share--progress continued on the Easton farm and interest in The Catholic Worker movement grew both at home and abroad. Most importantly, the various workers' children brought amusement and joy into everyone's lives.</dc:description>
