<dc:source>The Catholic Worker, February 1940, 7.</dc:source>
<dc:description>Restates the central vision of the Catholic Worker Movement as working for "a new heaven and a new <I>earth,</I> wherein justice dwelleth." This vision recognizes the "primacy of the spritual" and the doctrine of the Mystical Body of Christ. The Catholic Worker is "a new way of life" involving Houses of Hospitality for the daily practice of the Works of Mercy and Farming Communes where each person can take responsibility of doing their part.
