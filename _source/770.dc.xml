<dc:description>A tribute to a hard working and sometimes problematic Lituanian guest at Peter Maurin Farm. Quotes his recitation of his life of hard works and worries about a pension. "Here is a man who has worked hard all his life, who lives in poverty but is not destitute, and is always cheerful and ready to serve; we all love him."</dc:description>
