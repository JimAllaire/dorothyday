<dc:source>1939, Chapter Seven, pp. 121 - 136.</dc:source>
<dc:description>Fighting melancholy and overwork she wavers between justifying and blaming herself. Includes a mock dialogue with a "Critical Inquirer," examples of their arguments and conflicts, and sustaining quotes from spiritual writers. Sets a rule of life for herself and affirms that "those circumstances which surround us are the very ones God wills for us."</dc:description>
