<dc:title>Go To The Poor</dc:title>

<dc:source>The Catholic Worker, May 1942, 4.</dc:source>
<dc:description>Inspired by the beauty and inner-city location of Los Angeles' St. Bibiana Cathedral, this editorial focuses on the poor--" The closer we are to the poor, the closer to Christ's love." Because May, 1942 marked The Catholic Worker's tenth year, reminds readers that we are called to love all men, friend and foe alike, because all are brothers--"love is shown by works of mercy, not by war."</dc:description>
