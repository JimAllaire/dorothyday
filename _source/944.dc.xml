<dc:description>A loving tribute to Fr. Lacouture. Outlines his priestly assignments but highlights his famous "retreat" that emphasized man's dignity, the doctrine of the cross, and the call to saintliness. Says the retreat gave thousands great joy in the spiritual life. Notes the controversy that stopped the retreat, but also says, "He made all things new."</dc:description>
