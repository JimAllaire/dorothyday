<dc:description>Defines Christian personalism as "the realization of the dignity of the other fellow, of our obligation to him, the willingness to work with him, on those elements of truth he has seized hold of, accepting his cooperation as far as he will give it, and the refusal to admit 
disappointment when he doesn't go as far as we think he might." Argues that the Marshall Plan has denied this definition and is an extension of industrial capitalism and abrogates our personal responsibility.</dc:description>
