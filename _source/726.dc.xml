<dc:title>Vocation to Prison</dc:title>

<dc:description>In jail for civil disobedience she describes in graphic detail the experience of detention--noise, animality, despair, mistreatment, "the ugliness of it all". She has particular sympathy for the drug addicts and prostitutes. Sees her stay as visiting the prisoner and an opportunity to tell the story of those in jail. Points to the need for faith in small actions and for prayer.</dc:description>
