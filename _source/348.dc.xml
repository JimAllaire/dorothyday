<dc:description>Writes of a time of fasts and feasts--Orthodox Jews observing the Day of Atonement while their Italian neighbors continued to celebrate the Feast of San Gennaro. Tragedy marred the celebration--a drunken fight resulted in the fatal stabbing of a participant. While visiting with her neighbors during the fiesta, she reflects upon the hardships in her neighbors' lives, the acceptance with which they endured their poverty, and the enthusiasm with which they embraced the simple pleasures which came their way.</dc:description>
