<dc:description>Inspired by an exhibition of Georges Roualt's paintings, she considers his favorite themes--the judge, the prostitute, and the clown--saying there is some "of each in all of us." Describes people who live the folly of the Cross--a doctor living with the poor in Washington, those in conscientious objector camps, and those in jail for refusing the draft. Opposes peace-time conscription. Issues an appeal for <I>Blackfriars</I> magazine and recalls early meetings with Jacques Maritain.</dc:description>
