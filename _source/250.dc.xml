<dc:title>In Peace Is My Bitterness Most Bitter</dc:title>

<dc:source>The Catholic Worker, January 1967, 1, 2.</dc:source>
<dc:description>Expresses her anguish over the works of war in Vietnam, which are the opposite of the works of mercy. She is upset with churchmen calling for "total victory," and notes that the Church is our Mother even though "she is a harlot at times." Calls on each person to work on changing their hearts and attitude.</dc:description>
