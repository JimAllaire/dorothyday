<dc:description>A plea not to prejudge Angela Davis and Communists. Continues with many stories of interracial actions of Catholic Workers from the 30s onward, tying the horrible past and present war in Southeast Asia. Reminds us of the primarcy of the spiritual in the "little it is we do, or can do." Yet we are bound together, "members one of another." Even from evil God can bring great good.</dc:description>
