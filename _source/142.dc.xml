<dc:title>The Family vs Capitalism</dc:title>
<dc:author>Dorothy Day</dc:author>
<dc:source>The Catholic Worker, January 1936, 4.</dc:source>
<dc:description>Explains that the basic unit of society for Catholic sociology is the family, and when the family falls so does Catholicism. This is the reason for hostility to Communism and the same should be true for capitalism, since it creates a class that makes it difficult to sustain a family. Encourages family supportive programs.</dc:description>
