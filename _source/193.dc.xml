<dc:description>Decries the religious attitude that neglects the needs of this world in anticipation of "a fuller life" hereafter. Views this life as a "practice ground," an opportunity to use our talents to bring about justice and peace. Cites Ammon Hennacy and Peter Maurin as men who showed personal responsibility in this life. Everyone has the choice to bring about a better world aware that we are members of one family. We will be satisfied at death in God's rich mercy.</dc:description>
