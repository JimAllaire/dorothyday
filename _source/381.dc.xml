<dc:source>The Catholic Worker, April 1942, 1, 4.</dc:source>
<dc:description>Begins with an appeal for two worthy causes--the Bishop's relief fund for war victims and the New York Catholic Charities. Ponders the role of citizens during wartime and our penchant for choosing men of action, like General MacArthur, as heroes rather than figures like Pope Pius XII. Envisions speaking about rayer in Wartime, the rural life movement, feeding the poor and hungry, and the use of decentralism and other means for producing social change on an upcoming West Coast trip. Denies that her strict pacifism has split the Catholic Worker movement and points out that they face more reader-resistance for their policy against denying aid to the &quot;undeserving&quot; poor.</dc:description>
