<dc:source>The Catholic Worker, July-August 1964, 1, 6, 8.</dc:source>
<dc:description>Elaborates on the Catholic Worker relationship with Church authorities over many years and the "conflict of freedom and authority." Reaffirms the laity's freedom of conscience and leadership role in action against injustice. Reproaches "our shepherds" who fail to preach voluntary poverty and "preach the gospel in season, out of season, and that gospel is 'all men are brothers.'"</dc:description>
