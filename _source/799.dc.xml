<dc:description>On a speaking trip, weary of Winter travel, she mentions the strong interest in Cuba and the social changes in Latin America among her listeners. Visits her family in Vermont and extols family life as the ordinary way of working for the common good. Observes a group of men who had made "a cursillo, a course in Christianity" praying together and asks all to pray for men joined together in love.</dc:description>
