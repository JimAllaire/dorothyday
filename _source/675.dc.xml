<dc:description>Tender obituary of Fr. Pacifique Roy telling of his long involvement with the Catholic Worker--his love of work, reverent way he said Mass, joy in feasting, and how he introduced the workers to the famous "retreat" which "made us feel the power of love." Writes of his illness and death in his native Quebec.</dc:description>
