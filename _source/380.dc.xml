<dc:description>Shares her enthusiasm for Raisa Maritain's autobiography, <I>We Have Been Friends Together</I>. Defends their reaching out to all the poor, not just those deemed &quot;deserving&quot; of assistance. Reviews the positions taken on World War II by various Catholic Worker houses throughout the country, admitting that not all have their "in season, out of season" pacifism.</dc:description>
