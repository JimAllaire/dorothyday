<dc:source>The Catholic Worker, September 1945, 6.</dc:source>
<dc:description>Another chapter from her unpublished biography of P. Maurin. Describes St. Francis as the great personalist and goes on to explicate a philosophy of work. Sees it as a gift, a vocation that one should find what he/she does best and develop it. Encourages scholars to become workers and workers to become scholars in order that more understanding exit between the two. Defends Peter from the criticism of being a materialist and portrays him as an apostle to the world, not of the world.</dc:description>
