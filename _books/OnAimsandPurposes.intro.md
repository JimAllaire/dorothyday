#Introduction#

In 1933 there were 12.8 million unemployed, nearly 25% of the U.S. workforce. In the years since World War I there had grown disillusionment, economic collapse, and widespread attraction to movements on the right and the left--Fascism and Communism. 

Against this backdrop, *The Catholic Worker* newspaper was launched to aid  the reconstruction of the social order. In **To Our Readers** Dorothy states their overall purpose.

Dorothy always maintained that Peter Maurin's ideas were the foundation of the movement. In **Maurin's Program** we learn the three steps of Peter's vision:

>* roundtable discussions for the clarification of thought
>* houses of hospitality
>* farming colonies or agronomic universities

Seven years since the CW movement began, in **Aims and Purposes (1940)**, Dorothy restates their mission as working to create "a new heaven and a new *earth*." The doctrine of the Mystical Body of Christ is the spiritual foundation of our personal responsibility, here and now, for the good of all.

At their tenth anniversary, in the midst of World War II, with the movement having shrunk to only a few houses and their  pacifist stance unpopular, Dorothy succinctly states their purpose in **Aims and Purposes (1943)**: love our brother to show love of God. She asks a series of questions to challenge the reader to assess how they are living Christian teaching.

**Letter To Our Readers at the Beginning of Our Fifteenth Year** recapitulates Peter Maurin's program of action as they lived it the past fifteen years. The account is rich in historical detail and anecdotes about how Peter lived what he expounded.

Two issues of the paper later, in the July/August 1947 edition, Dorothy writes **What dream did they dream? Utopia or suffering?**. The article is an extended rumination about  her own and the movement's failures. The movement has shrunk, they are criticized  on all sides, she is disheartened. She sees a spirituality of self-denial and of the cross as a means to revitalize the movement.

**On Pilgrimage -- May 1948** recapitulates Peter Maurin's core vision, and Dorothy places their work in the wider context of the lay apostolate. However, she states what distinguishes the Catholic Worker is its pacifism and economics of distributism. 

In **Personalist--Peter Maurin** Dorothy sketches the background of Peter Maurin's thinking, the way he lived, what he said, and his social vision.

**Workers of the World Unite** celebrates the twenty-fifth anniversary of the movement. Dorothy reasserts their pacifism in the atomic age and personalizes their goals and her vocation. She includes anecdotes on how their mission evolved.

At their fortieth anniversary, in **On Pilgrimage -- May 1973**, Dorothy, now 76 years old, ruminates about the intellectual and spiritual sources of the movement and its relationship to the Church. She repeats Peter's three-point program.

Taken together, these articles form a mosaic of the central themes of the Catholic Worker Movement, themes that animate the work and spirit of 225 communities worldwide.
