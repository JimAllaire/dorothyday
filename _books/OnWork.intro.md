#Introduction#

*The Catholic Worker*  newspaper began in 1933 and aimed at an audience of workers. "It is printed to call their attention to the fact that the Catholic Church has a social program - to let them know that there are men of God who are working not only for their spiritual, but for their material welfare." [DDLW # 12]

The paper in the 1930s, in the midst of the Great Depression, was filled with coverage of strikes, unionizations efforts, and the plight of the unemployed. The advent of World War II effectively ended the Great Depression and full employment followed.

Dorothy wrote this series of five articles in 1946-1947. They cover the period of rapid industrialization shortly after World War II. Included are Peter Maurin's philosophy of work, the role of unions, and a critique of industrial capitalism and mechanized labor.

The article **The Church and Work** is a critique, sometimes harsh, of the industrial capitalist system and the inadequacy of the Church's efforts. She quotes at length from a document by Joseph Cardijn, who had started the Young Christian Workers movement in Europe in 1924. Dorothy rejects his effort to sanctify factory work when it dehumanizes workers. On a positive note, she quotes Eric Gill, a British distributist, and notes Peter Maurin's philosophy of labor. The theme of inadequate Church participation in the social struggle is found in all the articles in the series.

The articles are best approached as a pointillist painting, a series of dots that form an impression taken as a whole. 

In **Reflections on Work -- November 1946** Dorothy adopts a more reflective tone using stories to make her points. She offers alternatives to industrial capitalism and doesn't hesitate to disparage certain clerical practices that tend to support the system.

**Reflections on Work -- December 1946** is devoted to the bleak conditions for coal miners in Pennsylvania.

Again turning positive, in **Reflections on Work -- January 1947** she praises the social justice steps adopted by a French industrialist and the homesteading opportunities stressed by Canadian bishops.

The last article, **Reflections on Work -- March 1947**, reinforces her central themes: the need to change the social order, promote worker ownership, resist the industrial capitalist structures, and urging the clergy to get involved in the social struggle.
