#Introduction#

Virtually everything Dorothy wrote spoke of one form of hospitality or another, especially the columns she wrote about her speaking trips. These five articles focus on the why, how, and deeper meaning hospitality has for Dorothy and the movement.

**House of Hospitality** is a vivid account of how Dorothy and Peter Maurin found each other and the synergy of their vocations that started the Catholic Worker movement. Included are seven of Peter's *Easy Essays* on the theme of houses of hospitality. Once *The Catholic Worker* paper announced the CW program, volunteers and donations of money and furniture poured in. They found housing for staff and the homeless that came to them for food and a place to sleep. 

[Note: In 1939 when Dorothy wrote the book *House of Hospitality* there were 23 houses and four farms. In 2013 there are over 225 houses and farms world-wide.]

Written like an advice column, **Houses of Hospitality** counsels those interested in starting a House of Hospitality.

Not everyone liked the hospitality of Catholic Worker communities. In **Catholic Worker Ideas On Hospitality** Dorothy distinguishes their work from state hospitality, tracing CW hospitality to the gospels and monastic tradition. The CW doesn't discriminate on the side of the "deserving poor".

In **Room For Christ** Dorothy uses scripture and personal stories to drive home a simple yet profound teaching: without exception, acts of hospitality are acts done to Christ.

Dorothy's article **The Mystery of the Poor** is often quoted. After thirty years of offering hospitality, Dorothy expresses her certitude that the poor are Jesus, what is done for them is done for Him.
