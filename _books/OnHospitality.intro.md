#Introduction#

Virtually everything Dorothy wrote spoke of one form of hospitality or another, especially the columns she wrote about her speaking trips. These five articles focus on the why, how, and deeper meaning that hospitality has for Dorothy and the movement.

**House of Hospitality**, which is the introduction to her 1939 book, *House of Hospitality*, is a vivid account of how Dorothy and Peter Maurin found each other and the synergy of their vocations that started the Catholic Worker movement. Included are seven of Peter's *Easy Essays* on the theme of houses of hospitality. Once *The Catholic Worker* paper announced the CW program, volunteers and donations of money and furniture poured in. They found housing for staff and for the homeless that came to them for food and a place to sleep. 

[Note: In 1939 when Dorothy wrote *House of Hospitality*, there were twenty-three houses and four farms. In 2013 there are over 225 houses and farms worldwide.]

Written like an advice column, **Houses of Hospitality** counsels those interested in starting a House of Hospitality.

Not everyone liked the hospitality of Catholic Worker communities. In **Catholic Worker Ideas On Hospitality** Dorothy distinguishes their work from state or government-run hospitality, tracing CW hospitality to the gospels and the monastic tradition. The CW doesn't discriminate on the side of the "deserving poor."

In **Room For Christ** Dorothy uses scripture and personal stories to drive home a simple yet profound teaching: without exception, acts of hospitality are acts done to Christ.

Dorothy's article **The Mystery of the Poor** is often quoted. After thirty years of offering hospitality, Dorothy expresses her certitude that the poor are Jesus: what is done for them is done for Him.
