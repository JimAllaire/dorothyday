#Introduction#

Dorothy Day maintained that without Peter Maurin there would be no Catholic Worker Movement. These articles outline his teachings and Dorothy's deep admiration for him and the model he represented. She said he was a Saint Francis for our time.

She had always intended to write a book about Peter and his philosophy of personalism, his social analysis, his program for social reconstruction, and his holiness. When she died in 1980 the Maurin manuscript remained unfinished.

However, she wrote of Peter constantly in her columns and articles; nearly half of them say something about Peter.

The articles collected here appeared in *The Catholic Worker*  paper through the years and express her testament of his importance for the Catholic Worker Movement.

Rather than a linear or biographical organization, the articles taken together are like a impressionist painting which one has to step back from the dabs of color and broad strokes to see the intelligible whole.
